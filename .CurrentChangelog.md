### 0.8.1 (2021-06-18)

Features:

* Exported new functions in C API to import the `wasmedge_process` module.
  * `WasmEdge_ImportObjectCreateWasmEdgeProcess()` can create and initialize the `wasmedge_process` import object.
  * `WasmEdge_ImportObjectInitWasmEdgeProcess()` can initialize the given `wasmedge_process` import object.
* Exported new AOT compiler configuration setting C APIs.
  * Users can set the options about AOT optimization level, dump IR, and instruction counting and cost measuring in execution after compilation to the AOT compiler through C APIs.
* Updated error codes according to the [newest test suite of WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/test/core).
  * Applied the correct error message when trapping in the loading phase.
* Implemented the UTF-8 decoding in file manager.
* Implemented the basic name section parsing in custom sections.
* Added memory-mapped file helper, `MMap` for Linux.
  * Used `mmap` with `MAP_NORESERVE` for overcommited allocation.
  * Used `MMap` for file loading.
  * Merged `FileMgr` variants into one class.

Fixed issues:

* Applied the UTF-8 decoding.
  * Check the UTF-8 validation in custom sections, export sections, and import sections.
* Detected the redundant sections in modules.
  * Fixed this issue hence the sections rather than the custom section should be unique.
* Corrected the logging of data offset in the file while trap occurred in the loading phase.
  * Updated to the correct offset according to the refactored file manager.

Refactor:

* Updated manylinux\* dockerfiles.
  * Upgraded gcc to `11.1.0`.
  * Upgraded llvm to `11.1.0`.
  * Upgraded boost to `1.76`.
  * Moved environment variables to Dockerfile.
  * Used helper scripts to build.
* Moved the options of the AOT compiler into the `Configure` class.
* Refactor the file manager for supporting the `Unexpected end` loading malformed test cases.
  * Added the `setSectionSize` function to specify the reading boundary before the end of the file.
* Adjusted build scripts.
  * Set job pools for ninja generator.
  * Checked for newer compilers in `std::filesystem`.
  * Adjusted library dependency.

Documentations:

* Updated the [WasmEdge ecosystem](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/master/doc/ecosystem.md) document.
  * Renamed the `SSVM` related projects into `WasmEdge`.

Tools:

* Updated the `wasmedgec` AOT compiler tool for API changes of the `Configure`.

Tests:

* Turn on the `assert_malformed` tests for WASM binary in spec tests.
  * Apply the interpreter tests.
  * Apply the AOT tests.
  * Apply the API tests.
* Updated the API unit tests for the new `Configure` APIs.
* Updated the AST and loader unit tests.
  * Added test cases of file manager to raise the coverage.
  * Added test cases of every AST node to raise the coverage.
