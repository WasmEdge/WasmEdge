### 0.7.3 (2021-01-22)

Features:

* Updated the `easylogging++` to v9.97.0.
  * Disabled the file logging.
* Initial supported the `WASI` host functions for old system (CentOS 6).
  * Updated the `WASI` subscription insterface.
  * Used `pipe` for old `GLIBC`.
* Added supporting of subcommand in `PO`.
* Provided options to toggle white lists of `ssvm_process` in `ssvm` tool.
  * `--allow-command COMMAND` to add a command into white list in `ssvm_process` host functions. 
  * `--allow-command-all` to allow all commands in `ssvm_process` host functions.
* Added the documentation of [SSVM ecosystem](https://github.com/second-state/SSVM/blob/master/doc/ecosystem.md).

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the loading issues in `file manager`.
  * Refined performance and added error handling in `readBytes`.
  * Fixed `LEB128` and `ULEB128` decoding and error codes.
* Fixed security issues of executing commands in `ssvm_process` host functions.
  * Managed a white list for command execution.

Refactor:

* Used vector of instance instead of `std::unique_ptr` in AST nodes.
* Merged all instruction node classes.
  * Added `OpCode::Else` instruction.
  * Serialized the instruction sequences. Move out the block body of `If`, `Block`, and `Loop` instructions.
* Applied the proposal configuration checking in the loader phase.
  * Moved the `OpCode` and value type validation of proposal configuration checking to loader phase.
  * Fixed the logging message.
  * Added helper functions to clean codes of logging.
* Refactored the validator for instruction serialization.
  * Removed the duplicated proposal configuration checking done at the loader phase.
  * Serialized the instruction iterating when validating.
* Refactored the `Label` in `stack manager`.
  * `Label` will record the `from` instruction iterator that causes entering this label.
  * Removed the `next` instruction getter in `stack manager`.
* Refactored the instruction iterating mechanism in `interpreter`.
  * Used the `program counter` to iterate and execute the instructions.
  * Merged all switch cases of `OpCode`.
* Moved out `AOT` related proxy codes and helper functions in `interpreter` to dependent files.

Tools:

* Added `binfmt` supporting for `WASM` interpreter.
  * Please use the tool `tools/ssvm/ssvm-static` with the same arguments as `ssvm`.

Tests:

* Updated file manager tests for `LEB128` and `ULEB128` decoding.
* Updated AST tests for refactored AST nodes.
* Updated instruction tests for refactored instruction nodes.
* Added `PO` tests.
* Added `ssvm_process` tests.
