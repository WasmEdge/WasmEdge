### 0.9.0 (unreleased)

Breaking changes:

* Modulize the API Headers.
  * Moved the API header into the `wasmedge` folder. Developers should include the `wasmedge/wasmedge.h` for using the WasmEdge shared library after installation.
  * Moved the enumeration definitions into `enum_errcode.h`, `enum_types.h`, and `enum_configure.h` in the `wasmedge` folder.
* Apply old WebAssembly proposals options (All turned on by default).
  * Developers can use the `disable-import-export-mut-globals` to disable the Import/Export mutable globals proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
  * Developers can use the `disable-non-trap-float-to-int` to disable the Non-trapping float-to-int conversions proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
  * Developers can use the `disable-sign-extension-operators` to disable the Sign-extension operators proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
  * Developers can use the `disable-multi-value` to disable the Multi-value proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
* Adjusted the error code names.
  * Please refer to the [ErrCode enum](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/master/include/common/enum_errcode.h) definition.
* WasmEdge C API changes.
  * Deleted the data object column in the creation function of `ImportObject` context.
  * Added the data object column in the creation function of `HostFunction` context.
  * Instead of the unified data object of the host functions in the same import object before, the data objects are independent in every host functions now.

Refactor:

* Refactor the common headers.
  * Merged the building environment related definitions into `common`.
  * Separate all enumeration definitions.
* Updated the include path for rust binding due to the API headers refactoring.

Documentations:

* Updated the examples in the C API documentation.

Tests:

* Added `ErrInfo` unit tests.
* Added instruction tests for turning on/off the old proposals.
