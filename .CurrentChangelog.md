### 0.9.0 (unreleased)

Breaking changes:

* Modulize the API Headers.
  * Moved the API header into the `wasmedge` folder. Developers should include the `wasmedge/wasmedge.h` for using the WasmEdge shared library after installation.
  * Moved the enumeration definitions into `enum_errcode.h`, `enum_types.h`, and `enum_configure.h` in the `wasmedge` folder.
* Apply old WebAssembly proposals options (All turned on by default).
  * Developers can use the `disable-import-export-mut-globals` to disable the Import/Export mutable globals proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
  * Developers can use the `disable-non-trap-float-to-int` to disable the Non-trapping float-to-int conversions proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
  * Developers can use the `disable-sign-extension-operators` to disable the Sign-extension operators proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
  * Developers can use the `disable-multi-value` to disable the Multi-value proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
* Adjusted the error code names.
  * Please refer to the [ErrCode enum](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/master/include/common/enum_errcode.h) definition.
* WasmEdge C API changes.
  * Updated the host function related APIs.
    * Deleted the data object column in the creation function of `ImportObject` context.
    * Merged the `HostFunctionContext` into `FunctionInstanceContext`.
      * Deleted the `WasmEdge_HostFunctionContext` object. Please use the `WasmEdge_FunctionInstanceContext` object instead.
      * Deleted the `WasmEdge_HostFunctionCreate` function. Please use the `WasmEdge_FunctionInstanceCreate` function instead.
      * Deleted the `WasmEdge_HostFunctionCreateBinding` function. Please use the `WasmEdge_FunctionInstanceCreateBinding` function instead.
      * Deleted the `WasmEdge_HostFunctionDelete` function. Please use the `WasmEdge_FunctionInstanceDelete` function instead.
      * Deleted the `WasmEdge_ImportObjectAddHostFunction` function. Please use the `WasmEdge_ImportObjectAddFunction` function instead.
    * Added the data object column in the creation function of `FunctionInstance` context.
    * Instead of the unified data object of the host functions in the same import object before, the data objects are independent in every host functions now.
  * Added the WASM types contexts.
    * Added the `WasmEdge_TableTypeContext`, which is used for table instances creation.
    * Added the `WasmEdge_MemoryTypeContext`, which is used for memory instances creation.
    * Added the `WasmEdge_GlobalTypeContext`, which is used for global instances creation.
    * Added the member getter functions of above contexts.
  * Updated the instances creation APIs.
    * Used `WasmEdge_TableTypeContext` for table instances creation.
      * Removed `WasmEdge_TableInstanceGetRefType` API.
      * Developers can use the `WasmEdge_TableInstanceGetTableType` API to get the table type instead.
    * Used `WasmEdge_MemoryTypeContext` for memory instances creation.
      * Added `WasmEdge_MemoryInstanceGetMemoryType` API.
    * Used `WasmEdge_GlobalTypeContext` for global instances creation.
      * Removed `WasmEdge_GlobalInstanceGetValType` and `WasmEdge_GlobalInstanceGetMutability` API.
      * Developers can use the `WasmEdge_GlobalInstanceGetGlobalType` API to get the global type instead.

Refactor:

* Refined headers inclusion in all files.
* Refactor the common headers.
  * Removed the unnecessary `genNullRef()`.
  * Merged the building environment related definitions into `common`.
  * Merged the `common/values.h` into `common/types.h`.
  * Separate all enumeration definitions.
* Refactor the AST nodes.
  * Simplified the AST nodes definitions into header-only classes.
  * Moved the binary loading functions into `loader`.
  * Updated the `validator`, `interpreteer`, `runtime`, `api`, and `vm` for the AST node changes.
* Refactor the runtime objects.
  * Used `AST::FunctionType`, `AST::TableType`, `AST::MemoryType`, and `AST::GlobalType` for instance creation and member handling.
  * Removed `Runtime::Instance::FType` and used `AST::FunctionType` instead.
  * Added routines to push function instances into import objects.
* Updated the include path for rust binding due to the API headers refactoring.

Documentations:

* Updated the examples in the C API documentation.
* Updated the examples in the host function documentation.

Tests:

* Added `ErrInfo` unit tests.
* Added instruction tests for turning on/off the old proposals.
* Moved and updated the `AST` unit tests into `loader`.
* Added the unit tests for new APIs.
