### 0.13.3 (2023-07-25)

This is a bugfix release.

Features:

* [CMake] Add a flag to disable libtinfo (#2676)
* [Plugin] Implement OpenCV-mini (#2648)
* [CI] Build wasmedge on Nix (#2674)

Fixed issues:

* WASI Socket: Remove unused fds before closing them. (#2675), part of #2662

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on macOS platforms.
  * In the current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause a bus error during execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For a working around, please use the `--optimize=0` to set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in `wasmedgec` CLI.
* WasmEdge CLI failed on Windows 10 issue.
  * Please refer to [here for the workaround](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1559) if the `msvcp140.dll is missing` occurs.

Thank all the contributors that made this release possible!
