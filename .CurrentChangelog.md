  * Renamed the plugin API.
    * Renamed `WasmEdge_Plugin_loadWithDefaultPluginPaths()` to `WasmEdge_PluginLoadWithDefaultPaths()`.
* Dropped the manylinux1 and manylinux2010 support. Please refer to the [deprecation notice](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/discussions/1780).
* Standardize the SONAME and SOVERSION for WasmEdge C API
  * The name of the library is changed to `libwasmedge.so`, `libwasmedge.dyld`, and `wasmedge.dll`.
  * Users should change the linker flag from `lwasmedge_c` to `lwasmedge`.
  * The initialized SONAME is set to `libwasmedge.so.0`.
  * The initialized SOVERSION is set to `libwasmedge.so.0.0.0`.

Features:

* Updated CMake options of WasmEdge project.
  * Added `WASMEDGE_LINK_LLVM_STATIC` option to link the LLVM statically into WasmEdge shared library or tools.
  * Removed the `WASMEDGE_BUILD_STATIC_TOOLS` option and replaced by the `WASMEDGE_LINK_TOOLS_STATIC` option.
  * For details, please refer to the [documentation](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/extend/build.html#building-options).
  * After this version, our releases on MacOS platforms will link the LLVM library statically to reduce the installation of LLVM from Homebrew for the users.
* Supported the user-defined error code for host functions.
  * The 24-bit size user-defined error code is supported (smaller than 16777216).
  * Developers can use the `WasmEdge_ResultGen()` API to generate the result and return.
* Exported the `CallingFrame` instead of the memory instance in host functions.
  * New `WasmEdge_CallingFrameContext` struct.
  * Developers can use `WasmEdge_CallingFrameGetModuleInstance()` API to get the module instance of current top frame in calling stack in host function body.
  * Developers can use `WasmEdge_CallingFrameGetMemoryInstance()` API to get the memory instance by index in host function body.
    * To quickly upgrate from the previous WasmEdge versions, developer can use the `WasmEdge_CallingFrameGetMemoryInstance(Context, 0)` to get the same memory instance of the previous host function definition.
  * Developers can use `WasmEdge_CallingFrameGetExecutor()` API to get the executor context in host function body.
* Extended the `WasmEdge_Result` struct to support user defined error codes of host functions.
  * Added `WasmEdge_ResultGen()` API to generate the `WasmEdge_Result` struct of user defined error code.
  * Added `WasmEdge_ResultGetCategory()` API to get the error code category.
* Added a new API for looking up the native handler from a given WASI mapped Fd/Handler.
  * Added `WasmEdge_ModuleInstanceWASIGetNativeHandler` to get the native handler.
* Added a new API for compiling a given WASM byte array.
  * Added `WasmEdge_CompilerCompileFromBuffer` to compile from buffer.
* Added `httpsreq` plugin on Linux platforms.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the binary format loading.
  * Fixed the error of immediate loading of const instructions in debug mode.
  * Updated the `memarg` of memory instructions for the multiple memories proposal changes.
* Fixed the AOT issues.
  * Fixed the missed mask of shift operands.
  * Fixed the fallback case of vector instructions if the `SSE4.1` is not supported on the x86_64 platforms or the `NEON` is not supported on the aarch64 platforms.
  * Fixed the `sdk_version` of `lld` warning on MacOS with LLVM 14.
* Fixed the unexpected error message when execution.
  * Refined the terminated case to prevent from printing the unexpected error message.
* Refined the symbols of output WasmEdge shared libraries.
  * Removed the weak symbol of WasmEdge plugins.
  * Hide the `lld` symbols of WasmEdge shared library.
* Fixed the release packaging.
  * Fixed the lost of statically linking LLVM into WasmEdge shared library.
  * Fixed the lost of files when packaging on Windows.

Refactor:

* Reorginized the CI workflows to reuse the similar jobs.
* Refactored the enum related headers.
  * Separated the C and C++ enum definition headers.
  * Not to package the C++ related headers.
* Updated the WASI and plugin host functions for the API change.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on MacOS platforms.
  * In current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause bus error when execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please use the shared library format output of the AOT mode, or set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in WasmEdge C API.
  * Developers can specify the extension name as `.dylib` on MacOS for the shared library format output when using `wasmedgec` tool.
* WasmEdge CLI failed on Windows 10 issue.
  * Please refer to [here for the workaround](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1559) if the `msvcp140.dll is missing` occurs.
* Plug-in linking on MacOS platforms.
  * The plug-in on MacOS platforms will cause symbol not found when dynamic linking.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please implement the host modules instead of plug-ins.

Documentations:
