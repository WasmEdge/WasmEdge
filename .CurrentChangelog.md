Features:

* Supported the WASM `tail-call` proposal.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Proposal_TailCall` for the configuration in WasmEdge C API.
  * Users can use the `--enable-tail-call` to enable the proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec` tools.
* Supported the WASM `extended-const` proposal.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Proposal_ExtendedConst` for the configuration in WasmEdge C API.
  * Users can use the `--enable-extended-const` to enable the proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec` tools.
* Supported thread-safe in `WasmEdge_VMContext`, `WasmEdge_ConfigureContext`, `WasmEdge_ModuleInstanceContext`, and `WasmEdge_StoreContext` APIs.
* Supported the gas limit in AOT mode.
* New supporting of the wasi-socket proposal.
  * Supported `send_to`.
  * Supported `resv_from`.
* Plugin support
  * Add loadable plugin support.
  * Move `wasmedge_process` to a loadable plugin.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed wasi-socket proposal issues.
  * Fixed wasi-socket on MacOS.
  * Fixed error when calling `poll_oneoff` with the same `fd` twice.
  * Fixed error when calling `fd_close` on socket.
  * Forged zero-terminated string for `::getaddrinfo`.
  * Checked the socket options enumeration for valid value.
* Fixed the statistics enable/disable routine.
* Fixed the output format by the file extension name detection on multiple platforms.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on MacOS platforms.
  * In current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler on MacOS platforms will cause bus error when execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please use the shared library format output of the AOT mode.
  * Developers can specify the extension name as `.dylib` on MacOS, `.so` on Linux, and `.dll` on Windows for the shared library format output of the AOT compiler.

Refactor:

* Supported multi-thread execution.
  * Changed the `StackManager` in `Executor` as thread local to support the multi-thread.
  * Used atomic operations for cost measuring.
  * Supported multi-thread timer.
* Refactored the enumerations.
  * Replaced the `std::unordered_map` of the enumeration strings with `DenseMap` and `SpareMap`.
  * Merged the both C and C++ enumeration definitions into the `enum.inc` file.
  * Updated the `ErrCode` enumeration for the newest spec tests.
* Refactored the code architecture for supporting `tail-call` proposal.
  * Split the `call_indirect` execution routine in compiler into AOT and interpreter path.
  * Updated the pop frame mechanism in the `StackManager`.
  * Updated the enter function mechanism.
* Refined the file manager in `Loader`.
  * Supported the offset seeking in file and buffer.
  * Skipped the instructions parsing in AOT mode for better loading performance.
* Refined the branch mechanism in the `StackManager` for better performance in the interpreter mode.
  * Pre-calculated the stack offset for branch in the validation phase.
  * Removed the label stack in the `StackManager` and used the pre-calculated data for branch.
  * Removed the dummy frame mechanism in the `StackManager`.
* Supplied the pointer-based retrieving mechanism in the `StoreManager` and `ModuleInstance`.
  * Removed the address mechanism for instances in the `StoreManager`.
  * Added the unsafe getter functions for the instances.
* Refactored the `StoreManager`, `ModuleInstance`, and `Executor`.
  * Used the `ModuleInstance`-based resource management instead of `StoreManager`-based.
  * Moved the ownership of instances from the `StoreManager` into the `ModuleInstance`.
  * Merged the `ImportObject` into the `ModuleInstance`.
  * Invoking functions by `FunctionInstance` rather than the function name in `Executor`.
