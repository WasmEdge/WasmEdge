### 0.10.1-alpha.1 (2022-06-22)

Features:

* Supported WASI-NN plug-in with OpenVINO backend on Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64.
  * Users can refer to the [standard extension status](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/intro/standard.html) for the information.
* Supported the WASM `threads` proposal.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Proposal_Threads` for the configuration in WasmEdge C API.
  * Users can use the `--enable-threads` to enable the proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec` tools.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the WasmEdge C API static library on MacOS with LLVM 14.
  * The WasmEdge C API static library is in experimental and not guaranteed. The shared library is recommended.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on MacOS platforms.
  * In current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler on MacOS platforms will cause bus error when execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please use the shared library format output of the AOT mode.
  * Developers can specify the extension name as `.dylib` on MacOS, `.so` on Linux, and `.dll` on Windows for the shared library format output of the AOT compiler.
* WasmEdge CLI failed on Windows 10 issue.
  * Please refer to [here for the workaround](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1559) if the `msvcp140.dll is missing` occurs.
* Plug-in linking on MacOS platforms.
  * The plug-in on MacOS platforms will cause symbol not found when dynamic linking.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please implement the host modules instead of plug-ins.

Documentations:

* Added the [documentation for WASI-NN supporting on WasmEdge](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/dev/rust/wasinn.html).

Tests:

* Added the spec tests for the `threads` proposal.
* Added the WASI-NN unit tests.
