  * Users can refer to the [standard extension status](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/intro/standard.html) for the information.
  * For building with enabling WASI-NN with OpenVINO backend, please add the `-DWASMEDGE_PLUGIN_WASI_NN_BACKEND="OpenVINO"` in `cmake`.
* Supported WASI-crypto plug-in on Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64, manylinux2014 x86_64, and manylinux2014 aarch64.
  * Users can refer to the [standard extension status](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/intro/standard.html) for the information.
  * For building with enabling WASI-crypto with OpenSSL 1.1, please add the `-DWASMEDGE_PLUGIN_WASI_CRYPTO=ON` in `cmake`.
* Added the static tool building option.
  * By default, WasmEdge tools will depend on the WasmEdge shared library.
  * Developers can add the `-DWASMEDGE_BUILD_STATIC_LIB=On` and `-DWASMEDGE_BUILD_STATIC_TOOLS=On` to build the stand-alone WasmEdge CLI tools.
* Exported the components of `WasmEdge_VMContext` in WasmEdge C API.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_VMGetLoaderContext` API for retrieving the `WasmEdge_LoaderContext` in VM.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_VMGetValidatorContext` API for retrieving the `WasmEdge_ValidatorContext` in VM.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_VMGetExecutorContext` API for retrieving the `WasmEdge_ExecutorContext` in VM.
* Added the API for CLI tools.
  * Developers can use the `WasmEdge_Driver_Compiler` API to trigger the WasmEdge AOT compiler tool.
  * Developers can use the `WasmEdge_Driver_Tool` API to trigger the WasmEdge runtime tool.
* Supported the WASM `threads` proposal.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Proposal_Threads` for the configuration in WasmEdge C API.
  * Users can use the `--enable-threads` to enable the proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec` tools.
* Supported LLVM 14 on MacOS.
  * Used the new `macho` in lld on LLVM-14 envronment.
  * Bumpped IWYU to 0.18 to be compatible with LLVM 14 on MacOS.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the universal WASM format failed on MacOS platforms.
  * Developers can specify the extension name as `.wasm` on MacOS as the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler to enable the AOT mode.
* Fixed the WasmEdge C API static library on MacOS with LLVM 14.
  * The WasmEdge C API static library is in experimental and not guaranteed. The shared library is recommended.
* Reduced the branch miss when instantiating AOT-compiled WASM.

Refactor:

* Moved the code of WasmEdge CLI tools into `WasmEdge::Driver`.
* Moved the plugin tests into the `test/plugins` folder.

Known issues:

* WasmEdge CLI failed on Windows 10 issue.
  * Please refer to [here for the workaround](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1559) if the `msvcp140.dll is missing` occurs.
* Plug-in linking on MacOS platforms.
  * The plug-in on MacOS platforms will cause symbol not found when dynamic linking.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please implement the host modules instead of plug-ins.

Documentations:

* Added the [documentation for WASI-NN supporting on WasmEdge](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/dev/rust/wasinn.html).

Tests:

* Added the spec tests for the `threads` proposal.
* Added the WASI-NN unit tests.
