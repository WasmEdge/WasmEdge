Features:

* Supported WASI-NN plug-in with OpenVINO backend on Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64.
  * Users can refer to the [standard extension status](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/intro/standard.html) for the information.
  * For building with enabling WASI-NN with OpenVINO backend, please add the `-DWASMEDGE_WASINN_BACKEND="OpenVINO"` in `cmake`.
* Supported the WASM `threads` proposal.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Proposal_Threads` for the configuration in WasmEdge C API.
  * Users can use the `--enable-threads` to enable the proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec` tools.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the universal WASM format failed on MacOS platforms.
  * Developers can specify the extension name as `.wasm` on MacOS as the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler to enable the AOT mode.
* Fixed the WasmEdge C API static library on MacOS with LLVM 14.
  * The WasmEdge C API static library is in experimental and not guaranteed. The shared library is recommended.

  * The plug-in on MacOS platforms will cause symbol not found when dynamic linking.
