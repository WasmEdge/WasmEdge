### 0.14.1-beta.2 (2024-07-18)

Features:

* Supported LLVM 17.0.6.
* [WASI-NN] ggml backend:
  * Bump llama.cpp to b3405.
  * Static link `libggml` and `libllama`.
  * Refine the CMake to support multiple backends of WASI-NN with ggml backend.
* [WASI-NN] Added support for neural speed backend.
* [WASI-NN] Added support for whisper.cpp backend.
* [Plugin] Supported `wasmedge_stablediffusion` plug-in.
* [Proposal] Initial support for instantiation phase of component model.
* [Proposal] Supported WASM Relaxed-SIMD proposal.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Proposal_RelaxSIMD` for the configuration in WasmEdge C API.
  * Users can use the `--enable-relaxed-simd` to enable the proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec` tools.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the `fmt` related header inclusion for error logging.
* Fixed WASI test error in Windows.

Tests:

* Added WASI test suites on Windows.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on macOS platforms.
  * In the current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause a bus error during execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For a working around, please use the `--optimize=0` to set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in `wasmedgec` CLI.

Thank all the contributors who made this release possible!
