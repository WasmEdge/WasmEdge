    * Removed the `WasmEdge_HostRegistration_WasiCrypto_Symmetric` enum and the `WasmEdge_ModuleInstanceCreateWasiCryptoSymmetric()` API.
    * Removed the `WasmEdge_HostRegistration_WasmEdge_Process` enum and the `WasmEdge_ModuleInstanceCreateWasmEdgeProcess()` API.
* Changed the `WasmEdge_VMCleanup()` behavior.
  * After calling this API, the registered modules except the WASI and plug-ins will all be cleaned.
* Standaloned the `WasmEdge-Process` plug-in.
  * After this version, users should use the installer to install the `WasmEdge-Process` plug-in.

  * Added the `WasmEdge_PluginLoadFromPath()` API for loading a plug-in from a specific path.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_PluginListPluginsLength()` and `WasmEdge_PluginListPlugins()` APIs for getting the loaded plug-in names.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_PluginFind()` API for retrieving a loaded plug-in by its name.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_PluginGetPluginName()` API for retrieving the plug-in name.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_PluginListModuleLength()` and `WasmEdge_PluginListModule()` APIs for listing the module names of a plug-in.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_PluginCreateModule()` API for creating the specific module instance in a plug-in by its name.
* Added the `VM` APIs.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_VMGetRegisteredModule()` API for retrieving a registered module by its name.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_VMListRegisteredModuleLength()` and `WasmEdge_VMListRegisteredModule()` APIs for listing the registered module names.
* Introduced the python version WasmEdge installer.
* Added the `wasm_bpf` plug-in.
* Enabled the read-only WASI filesystem.
  * Users can add the `--dir guest_path:host_path:readonly` option in WasmEdge CLI to assign the read-only configuration.
* Updated the ABI of the `wasi_ephemeral_sock`.
  * Added the output port of the `sock_recv_from`.
  * Updated the API of `sock_getlocaladdr`.
  * Unified the socket address size to 128-bit.
* Allowed the multiple VM instances.
* Supported using `libtool` to archive the WasmEdge static library.
* Supported LLVM 15.0.7.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed WASI issues.
  * Fixed the leaking information about the host STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR after getting the `filestat`.
  * Fixed the lookup of symbolic link at `path_filestat_set_times`.
  * Fixed `open` for the wchar path issue on windows.
  * Fixed the rights of `path_open`.
* Fixed WASI-NN issues.
  * Fixed the definition of `wasi_nn::TensorType` to prevent from comparing with dirty data.
* Fixed WASI-Crypto issues.
  * Fixed the `keypair_generate` for rsa-pss.
  * Fixed the `keypair_import` read pem as pkcs8.
* Fixed WASI-Socket issues.
  * Fixed the buffer size of `sock_getpeeraddr`.
* Fixed the lost intrinsics table in AOT mode when using the WasmEdge C API.
* Fixed the registration failed of WasmEdge plug-in through the C API.
* Fixed the implementation in `threads` proposal.
  * Fixed the error in `atomic.nofify` and `atomic.wait` instructions.
  * Fixed the decoding of `atomic.fence` instruction.
  * Corrected the error message of waiting on unshared memory.
* Handle canonical and arithmetical `NaN` in `runMaxOp()` and `runMinOp()`.

Refactor:

* Refactored the implementation of number loading in the file manager.
  * Supported `s33` and `sn` loading and decoding.
* Refactored the `WasmEdge::ValType`.
  * Removed the `WasmEdge::ValType::None`.
  * Used the flag in `WasmEdge::BlockType` for supporting the type index.
  * Removed the `WasmEdge::Validator::VType` and used the `WasmEdge::ValType` instead.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on MacOS platforms.
  * In current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause bus error when execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please use the `--optimize=0` to set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in `wasmedgec` CLI.
* WasmEdge CLI failed on Windows 10 issue.
  * Please refer to [here for the workaround](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1559) if the `msvcp140.dll is missing` occurs.
* Plug-in linking on MacOS platforms.
  * The plug-in on MacOS platforms will cause symbol not found when dynamic linking.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please implement the host modules instead of plug-ins.

Documentations:

* Fixed various typos.
* Updated the C API documents.
* Added the [WasmEdge installer guide](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/contribute/installer.html).
* Updated the [Android NDK example](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/contribute/build_from_src/android/ndk.html).
* Added the [static library linking guide](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/sdk/c/library.html#link-with-wasmedge-static-library).
* Added the [WasmEdge plug-in implementation guide](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/develop_plugin/c.html).

Tests:

* Updated the WASM spec tests to the date 2022/12/15.
* Added the plug-in unit tests on Linux platforms.
