### 0.8.0 (2021-05-13)

Breaking changes:

* Renamed this project to `WasmEdge` (formerly `ssvm`).
  * The tool `wasmedge` is the WebAssembly runtime (formerly `ssvm`).
  * The tool `wasmedgec` is the WebAssembly AOT compiler (formerly `ssvmc`).
* Renamed the CMake options.
  * Option `BUILD_AOT_RUNTIME` (formerly `SSVM_DISABLE_AOT_RUNTIME` and `OFF` by default), which is `ON` by default, is for enabling the compilation of the ahead-of-Time compiler.
* Turned on the `reference-types` and `bulk-memory-operations` proposals by default in tools.
  * Users can use the `disable-bulk-memory` to disable the `bulk-memory-operations` proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.
  * Users can use the `disable-reference-types` to disable the `reference-types` proposal in `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec`.

Features:

* Added `WasmEdge` C API and shared library.
  * Developers can include the `wasmedge.h` and link the `libwasmedge_c.so` for compiling and running `WASM`.
  * Add CMake option `BUILD_SHARED_LIB` to enable compiling the shared library (`ON` by default).
  * The APIs about the ahead-of-time compiler will always return failed if the CMake option `BUILD_AOT_RUNTIME` is set as `OFF`.
* Added `common/version.h`: define the package version from `cmake`.
* Updated `Configure`.
  * Turned on the `reference-types` and `bulk-memory-operations` proposals by default.
  * Supports memory page limitation for limiting the largest available pages in memory instances.
* Added a function in `Log` to enable the debug logging level.
* Added global options with subcommands into `PO`.
* Added an API into `StoreManager` to list the registered module names.
* Added an API into `TableInstance` to grow table with `ref.null`.
* Updated `SIMD` implementation with the newest [SIMD proposal](https://github.com/webassembly/simd).
* Supported `AOT` compile cache.
  * Added `blake3` hash calculator to calculate hash for caching files.
* Added an API into `VM` for loading `WASM` module from `AST::Module`.

Fixed issues:

* Adjusted and fixed cmake issues.
  * Used `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` in this project for supporting to be as a submodule.
  * Assigned a default version number (`0.0.0-unreleased`) when getting the version from git describe failed.
  * Fixed `boost` include variable names.
* Fixed `WASI` `poll_oneoff`.
  * Allow `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` while waiting for the file descriptor and check `SIGTERM` after `epoll`.
* Rearranged variables for CPU feature detection in `AOT` compiler.
* Fixed `Validator` errors.
  * Fixed the error in `br_table` for pushing wrong types into validation stack.
  * Fixed the error in `global_set` for iterating illegal indices.
* Fixed `Interpreter` errors.
  * Fixed the failed case that not returned the errors except `ErrCode::ExecutionFailed` when invoking the host functions.
  * Not to return success when the `ErrCode::Terminated` occurs.
* Fixed the unmapping size in the destructor of `MemoryInstance`.

Refactor:

* Merged the `CostTable` class into `Statistics`.
  * Simplified the API for getting and setting cost table.
  * Initialized the costs for every instruction as `1` by default.
* Merged the `Proposal` and `HostRegistration` configurations into `Configure`.
  * Adjusted the `Proposal` order.
* Applied the copy of `Configure` in `Loader`, `Validator`, `Interpreter`, and `VM` instead of passing by reference.
* Refactored the functions in the `StoreManager`.
  * Updated the templates of functions to register instances.
  * Forwarded the parameters to reduce moving.
* Refactored and used the `std::variant` to save space in `FunctionInstance`.
* Applied function parameter type checking when invoking a wasm function in `Interpreter`.
* Set the module instantiation as the anonymous active module in `Interpreter`.
* Added the `const` quantifier in `get` and `load` data functions of `MemoryInstance`.

Tools:

* `wasmedge`: WebAssembly runtime (formerly `ssvm`)
  * Turned on the `bulk-memory-operations` and `reference-types` proposals by default.

    * For the `WasmEdge 0.8.0`, we use the `wasm-dev-0.8.0` tag for the core tests and the `SIMD` proposal tests.
  * Adjusted the code architecture for core testing.
    * Combined the duplicated functions into the `SpecTest` class.
    * Split out the `spectest` host function definitions for importing repeatedly.
* Added `WasmEdge` C API tests.
  * Added unit tests for APIs in the `WasmEdge` shared library.
  * Applied WASM core tests for the `WasmEdge` shared library in both using `Interpreter` APIs and `VM` APIs.
