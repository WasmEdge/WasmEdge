### 0.11.1-rc.1 (2022-09-28)

Features:

* Supported WASI-NN plug-in with PyTorch backend on Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64.
  * Users can refer to the [WASI-NN document](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/write_wasm/rust/wasinn.html) for the information.
  * For building with enabling WASI-NN with PyTorch backend, please add the `-DWASMEDGE_PLUGIN_WASI_NN_BACKEND="PyTorch"` in `cmake`.
* Updated the WASI-Crypto proposal and supported OpenSSL 3.0.
* Supported LLVM 15.
* Added the plug-in C API.
* Extended WasmEdge CLI.
  * Allow the optimization level assignment in `wasmedgec` tool.
  * Supported the `v128` value type printing in `wasmedge` tool.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the `private` members into the `protected` in the module instance class.
* Fixed the type mismatch for IntrinsicsTable initialization statement in the AOT compiler.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on MacOS platforms.
  * In current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause bus error when execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please use the `--optimize=0` to set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in `wasmedgec` CLI.
* WasmEdge CLI failed on Windows 10 issue.
  * Please refer to [here for the workaround](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1559) if the `msvcp140.dll is missing` occurs.
* Plug-in linking on MacOS platforms.
  * The plug-in on MacOS platforms will cause symbol not found when dynamic linking.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please implement the host modules instead of plug-ins.

Documentations:

* Refactored the [WasmEdge book](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/).

Tests:

* Added the WASI-NN PyTorch backend unit test.
* Added fuzzing tests for WasmEdge CLI.
