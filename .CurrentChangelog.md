### 0.14.2 (2025-01-05)

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the overflow issue of getting memory over 32-bit offset.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on macOS platforms.
  * In the current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause a bus error during execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For a working around, please use the `--optimize=0` to set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in `wasmedgec` CLI.

Thank all the contributors who made this release possible!
