* Unified the `wasmedge` CLI tool.
  * Supported the subcommand `run` and `compile` for the `wasmedge` CLI.
  * Users now can use the command `wasmedge run [ARGS]` to drive the original `wasmedge` tool.
  * Users now can use the command `wasmedge compile [ARGS]` to drive the original `wasmedgec` AOT compiler tool.
* Made WasmEdge on `armv7l` great again.
* Bumpped `spdlog` to `v1.11.0`.
  * Refactored the logs to use the `fmt` for formatting.
* Bumpped `blake3` to `1.3.3`.
* Added the CMake option `WASMEDGE_ENABLE_UB_SANITIZER` to enable the undefined behavior sanitizer.
* Deprecated the `wasmedge_httpsreq` plug-in.
* Migrated the WasmEdge extensions into plug-ins.
  * Migrated the [WasmEdge-image](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-image) into the `wasmedge_image` plug-in.
  * Migrated the [WasmEdge-tensorflow](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-tensorflow) into the `wasmedge_tensorflow` and `wasmedge_tensorflowlite` plug-ins.
  * Supported `manylinux2014_x86_64`, `manylinux2014_aarch64`, `darwin_x86_64`, and `darwin_arm64` platforms for the above plug-ins.
* Introduced the `wasi_logging` plug-in.
* Added GPU support for WASI-NN PyTorch backend.
* New APIs for containing data into module instances when in creation.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_ModuleInstanceCreateWithData()` API for creating a module instance with data and its finalizer callback function pointer.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_ModuleInstanceGetHostData()` API for accessing the host data set into the module instance.
* Supported the async invocation with executor.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_ExecutorAsyncInvoke()` API for invoking a WASM function asynchronously.
* Added helper functions for Windows CLI.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Driver_ArgvCreate()` and `WasmEdge_Driver_ArgvDelete()` APIs to convert UTF-16 arguments to UTF-8.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Driver_SetConsoleOutputCPtoUTF8()` API to set the output code page to UTF-8.
* Added the unifed tool API.
  * Added the `WasmEdge_Driver_UniTool()` API to trigger the WasmEdge CLI tool with command line arguments.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed the WasmEdge C API static library linking command for `llvm-ar-14`.
* Fixed the undefined behavior issues in Loader and Validator.
* Fixed the WASI issues.
  * Denied the absolute path accessing.
  * Opened directories with `__WASI_OFLAGS_DIRECTORY` flag.
  * Don't use `O_PATH` unless flag is exactly `__WASI_OFLAGS_DIRECTORY`.
  * Removed seeking rights on directories.
  * Fixed checking wrong rights in `path_open`.
  * Allowed renumbering and closing preopened `fd`.
  * Disallowed accessing parent directory through `..`.
  * Don't write null pointer at end of args/envs pointer array.
  * Don't write first entry when buffer size is zero.
  * Removed unused VFS objects.
  * Fixed the `fd_readdir`.
  * Corrected the readonly inheriting right.
* Fixed plug-in issues.
  * Fixed the error enumeration in WASI-NN.
  * Fixed the error messages of tensor type in WASI-NN Tensorflow-Lite backend.
  * Handled the model data ownership in WASI-NN Tensorflow-Lite backend.
  * Returned error with the following cases in WASI-Crypto, because OpenSSL 3.0 didn't implement context duplication for `aes-gcm` and `chacha20`.

Refactor:

* Moved the Windows API definitions to `include/system/winapi.h`.
* Dropped the `boost` dependency.
  * Replaced the `boost` endian detection by the macros.
  * Used the `std::boyer_moore_horspool_searcher` instead.
* Refactored the functions for accessing slides on memory instances.
* Moved the `WasmEdge::VM::Async` class to the `include/common` for supporting async invocation in executor.
* Refactored the WASI host functions.
  * Removed duplicate codes on `poll_oneoff` with `edge-trigger` configuration.
  * Refactored Poller interface for reusing the same objects.
  * Supported absolute time flags for `poll_oneoff` on MacOS.
  * Used static vector to speedup CI.
  * Refactored the internal APIs of wasi-socket.
* Refactored the WASI-NN plug-in source.
  * Refined the WASI-NN dependency linking in CMake.
  * Separated the source files for different backends.

Documentations:

* Moved and published the WasmEdge document to <https://wasmedge.org/docs/>.
* Removed all WASM binary files in the source tree.

Tests:

* Updated the WASM spec tests to the date 2023/05/11.
* Added the plug-in unit tests and CI for Linux and MacOS platforms.
* Added new test cases of `cxx20::expected`.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on macOS platforms.
  * In the current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause a bus error during execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For a working around, please use the `--optimize=0` to set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in `wasmedgec` CLI.
* WasmEdge CLI failed on Windows 10 issue.
  * Please refer to [here for the workaround](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1559) if the `msvcp140.dll is missing` occurs.
