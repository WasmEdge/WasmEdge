### 0.12.0-alpha.1 (2022-12-23)

Features:

* Updated the WasmEdge shared library.
  * Due to the breaking change of ABI, bump the `SOVERSION` to `0.0.2`.
* Introduced the python version WasmEdge installer.
* Updated the ABI of the `wasi_ephemeral_sock`.
  * Added the output port of the `sock_recv_from`.
  * Updated the API of `sock_getlocaladdr`.
  * Unified the socket address size to 128-bit.
* Supported using `libtool` to archive the WasmEdge static library.

Fixed issues:

* Fixed WASI-NN issues.
  * Fixed the definition of `wasi_nn::TensorType` to prevent from comparing with dirty data.
* Fixed the lost intrinsics table in AOT mode when using the WasmEdge C API.
* Fixed the implementation in `threads` proposal.
  * Fixed the error in `atomic.nofify` and `atomic.wait` instructions.
  * Fixed the decoding of `atomic.fence` instruction.
  * Corrected the error message of waiting on unshared memory.

Refactor:

* Refactored the implementation of number loading in the file manager.
  * Supported `s33` and `sn` loading and decoding.
* Refactored the `WasmEdge::ValType`.
  * Removed the `WasmEdge::ValType::None`.
  * Used the flag in `WasmEdge::BlockType` for supporting the type index.
  * Removed the `WasmEdge::Validator::VType` and used the `WasmEdge::ValType` instead.

Known issues:

* Universal WASM format failed on MacOS platforms.
  * In current status, the universal WASM format output of the AOT compiler with the `O1` or upper optimizations on MacOS platforms will cause bus error when execution.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please use the `--optimize=0` to set the compiler optimization level to `O0` in `wasmedgec` CLI.
* WasmEdge CLI failed on Windows 10 issue.
  * Please refer to [here for the workaround](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/1559) if the `msvcp140.dll is missing` occurs.
* Plug-in linking on MacOS platforms.
  * The plug-in on MacOS platforms will cause symbol not found when dynamic linking.
  * We are trying to fix this issue. For working around, please implement the host modules instead of plug-ins.

Documentations:

* Fixed various typos.
* Updated the [Android NDK example](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/contribute/build_from_src/android/ndk.html).
* Added the [static library linking guide](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/sdk/c/library.html#link-with-wasmedge-static-library).

Tests:

* Updated the WASM spec tests to the date 2022/12/15.
