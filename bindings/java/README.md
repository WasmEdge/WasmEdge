# wasmedge-java

Because of the recent changes in the WasmEdge project, this Java binding is no longer maintained.
The reason is that this binding was developed based on the old C API (0.12.x),
and the new C API (0.13.x) is not compatible with the old one.
We do want to keep this binding up to date, but we don't have enough time to do so.
Since we are planning releases for 0.13.x, 0.14.x, and 0.15.x in the near future,
we will no longer be able to maintain this binding.
However, we still welcome contributions from the community.

Please refer to the [Deprecated Discussion Here](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/4191) for more details.
