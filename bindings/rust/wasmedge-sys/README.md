# Overview

The [wasmedge-sys](https://crates.io/crates/wasmedge-sys) crate defines a group of low-level Rust APIs for WasmEdge, a light-weight, high-performance, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud-native, edge, and decentralized applications.

For developers, it is recommended that the APIs in `wasmedge-sys` are used to construct high-level libraries, but not to build up applications.
