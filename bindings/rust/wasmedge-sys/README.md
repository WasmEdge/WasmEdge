# wasmedge-sys

The [wasmedge-sys](https://crates.io/crates/wasmedge-sys) crate defines a group of low-level Rust APIs, which simply wrap WasmEdge C APIs and provide the safe counterparts. It is recommended that the APIs in [wasmedge-sys](https://crates.io/crates/wasmedge-sys) are used to construct high-level libraries, but not to build up applications.
