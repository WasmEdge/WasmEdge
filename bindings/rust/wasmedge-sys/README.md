# Overview

** `wasmedge-sys` is under [wasmedge-rust-sdk/crates/wasmedge-sys](https://github.com/WasmEdge/wasmedge-rust-sdk/tree/main/crates/wasmedge-sys) now. **

The [wasmedge-sys](https://crates.io/crates/wasmedge-sys) crate defines a group of low-level Rust APIs for WasmEdge, a light-weight, high-performance, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud-native, edge, and decentralized applications.

For developers, it is recommended that the APIs in `wasmedge-sys` are used to construct high-level libraries, while `wasmedge-sdk` is for building up business applications.

* Notice that [wasmedge-sys](https://crates.io/crates/wasmedge-sys) requires **Rust v1.66 or above** in the **stable** channel.
