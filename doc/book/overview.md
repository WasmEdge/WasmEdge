WasmEdge (previously known as SSVM) is a high-performance WebAssembly (Wasm) VM optimized for Edge Computing, including Edge Clouds and Software Defined Vehicles. In its AOT mode, WasmEdge is the [fastest Wasm VM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9214403) on the market today.


WasmEdge is an official sandbox project hosted by [CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)](https://www.cncf.io/).


The most important use case for WasmEdge is to safely execute user-defined or community-contributed code as plug-ins in a software product (e.g., a SaaS, a car OS, an edge node, or even a blockchain node). It enables third-party developers, vendors, suppliers, and community members to extend and customize the software product. With WasmEdge, a software product could become a host platform.
