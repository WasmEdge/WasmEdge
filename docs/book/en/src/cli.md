# WasmEdge Command Line Tools

After the [WasmEdge installation](quick_start/install.md), the `wasmedge` tool is installed.

Users can use the WasmEdge CLI tool to execute the WebAssembly files quickly.

* The [`wasmedge` CLI tool](cli/wasmedge.md) is the WebAssembly runtime to execute the WASM files.

* The original `wasmedgec` tool is changed to `wasmedge compile`. The [`wasmedge compile` CLI tool](cli/wasmedge_compile.md) is the ahead-of-time compiler to compile the WebAssembly file into native code.
