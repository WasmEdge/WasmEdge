# WasmEdge Command Line Tools

After the [WasmEdge installation](quick_start/install.md), the `wasmedge` and `wasmedgec` tools are installed.

Users can use these WasmEdge CLI tools to execute the WebAssembly files quickly.

* The [`wasmedge` CLI tool](cli/wasmedge.md) is the WebAssembly runtime to execute the WASM files.
* The [`wasmedgec` CLI tool](cli/wasmedgec.md) is the ahead-of-time compiler to compile the WebAssembly file into native code.
