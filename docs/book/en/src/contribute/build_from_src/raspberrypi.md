# Build WasmEdge for Raspberry Pi 3/4

Raspberry Pi uses 64-bit processors starting from the 3 Model B. So WasmEdge can be executed on Raspberry Pi as well. You can choose any 64-bit Linux distribution, such as Raspbian, Ubuntu or Manjaro for ARM. This document has been tested on the Manjaro for ARM distribution and the hardware is the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

The installation steps are no different from the [installation document](../../quick_start/install.md), and the execution is the same. Here's a video about installing WasmEdge and running a simple WebAssembly module to add two numbers up.
