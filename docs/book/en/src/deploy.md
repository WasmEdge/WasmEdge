# Use WasmEdge on an established framework or platform

In the previous chapter, we discussed how to programmatically embed WasmEdge programs and functions into your own applications using WasmEdge SDKs.
However, most developers need to use other 3rd party frameworks or platforms.
Many established frameworks and application platforms also provide
their own APIs to embed WasmEdge. These APIs are typically built upon WasmEdge
CLI or SDKs, but provide a better experience
for users and developers who are already familar with the framework or platform.
