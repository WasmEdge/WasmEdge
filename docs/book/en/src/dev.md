# Develop a WasmEdge app

A key value proposition of WebAssembly is that it supports multiple programming languages. WebAssembly is a "managed runtime" for many programming languages including C/C++, Rust, Go, Swift, Kotlin, AssemblyScript, Grain and even JavaScript and Python.

* For compiled languages (e.g., C and Rust), WasmEdge WebAssembly provides a safe, secure, isolated, and containerized runtime as opposed to Native Client (NaCl).
* For interpreted or managed languages (e.g., JavaScript and Python), WasmEdge WebAssembly provides a secure, fast, lightweight, and containerized runtime as opposed to Docker + guest OS + native interpreter.

In this chapter, we will discuss how to compile and run programs in different languages in WasmEdge.
