# Rust

Rust is one of the first-class citizens in the WebAssembly ecosystem. The toolchains for compiling Rust to WebAssembly are much more mature than other languages. 

In this chapter, we will show you how to complie your Rust applications to wasm bytecode and run in the WasmEdege runtime. We also will demonstrate how to use the customized WasmEdge Rust SDK in your applications.


* [Bindgen and rustwasmc](rust/bindgen.md) shows how to use rustwasmc to comiple `lib.rs` Rust function to WebAssembly.
* [Tensorflow](rust/tensorflow,md) shows how to apply the WasmEdge TensorFlow SDK into your Rust code.
* [Networking socket](rust/networking.md) shows how to apply the Networking Socket SDK into your Rust code
* [Command interface](rust/command.md) shows how to use Command Interface in your Rust code.
