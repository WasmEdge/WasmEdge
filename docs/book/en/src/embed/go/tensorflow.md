# Tensorflow

In this section, we will show you how to create a Tensorflow inference
function in Rust for image classification, and then embed it into 
a Go application. The project source code is [available here](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go-examples/tree/master/go_Mobilenet).

The Rust function for image classification is [available here]().
It utilizes the [WasmEdge Tensorflow extension API](../../dev/rust/tensorflow.md).
