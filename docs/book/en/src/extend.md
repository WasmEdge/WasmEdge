# Extend WasmEdge

One of the most important features of WasmEdge is its extensibility.
Through extensions, WasmEdge applications can use languages like 
Rust, C, and JavaScript to access features and functionalities
provided by the operating systems or shared libraries.

* The WasmEdge plug-in API allows developers to create extentions that can be distributed with official WasmEdge releases.
* The host functions API in WasmEdge SDKs allows you to create your own customized WebAssembly runtime based on WasmEdge.
