# Contribute to WasmEdge

One of the most important features of WasmEdge is its extensibility.
Through extensions, WasmEdge applications can use languages like Rust, C, and JavaScript to access features and functionalities provided by the operating systems or shared libraries.

In this chapter, we will cover how to build WasmEdge from source code for different operating systems and platforms.
We will then discuss the WasmEdge plug-in API, which allows developers to create extensions that can be distributed with official WasmEdge releases.
