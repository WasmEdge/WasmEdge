# WasmEdge plug-in API

WasmEdge provides a C++ based API for registering extensions 
and host functions. While the WasmEdge language SDKs allow
registering host functions from a host (wrapping) application, the
plugin API allows such extensions to be incorporated into WasmEdge's
own building and releasing process.

In fact, the WasmEdge extensions for Tensorflow, image processing, 
key-value storage etc are all implemented using the plugin API. 
The plugin API is how you could contribute new functions to the
WasmEdge Runtime itself.
