# Cloud-native runtime (as a lightweight Docker alternative)

WasmEdge can be embedded into cloud-native infrastructure via its SDKs in [C](../../embed/c.md), [Go](../../embed/go.md), [Rust](../../embed/rust.md), and [JavaScript](../../embed/node.md). It is also an OCI compliant runtime that can be directly [managed by CRI-O and Docker tools](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/manage-webassembly-apps-in-wasmedge-using-docker-tools/) as a lightweight and high-performance alternative to Docker.
