# CRI runtimes

The high-level container runtime, such as [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/) and [containerd](https://containerd.io/), pulls container images from registries (e.g., Docker Hub), manages them on disk, and launches a lower-level runtime to run container processes.
From this chapter, you can check out specific tutorials for CRI-O and containerd.
