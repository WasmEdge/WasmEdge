The WasmEdge Runtime releases come with pre-built binaries for the Android OS. However, the WasmEdge installer does not support Android. The user must download the release files to a computer, and then use the `adb` tool to transfer the files to an Android device or simulator. We will show you how to do that.

> If you prefer to build WasmEdge Runtime binary on Android for yourself, you can refer to the [build WasmEdge for Android](../extend/build_for_android.md) document.
