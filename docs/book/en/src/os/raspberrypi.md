# Raspberry Pi 3/4

Raspberry Pi uses 64-bit processors starting with the 3B model, so WasmEdge can be executed on Raspberry Pi as well. You can choose any 64-bit Linux distribution, such as Raspbian, Ubuntu or Manjaro for ARM. This document has been tested on the Manjaro for ARM distribution and the hardware is the Raspberry Pi 3b.

The installation steps are no different from the [installation document](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/start/install.html), and the execution is the same. Here's a video about installing WasmEdge and running a simple WebAssembly module to add two numbers up.
