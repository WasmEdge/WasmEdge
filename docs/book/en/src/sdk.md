# Use WasmEdge Library in Programming Languages

Besides using the WasmEdge command line tools to executing the WebAssembly applications, WasmEdge also provides SDKs for various programming languages.
The WasmEdge library allows developers to embed the WasmEdge into their host applications, so that the WebAssembly applications can be executed in the WasmEdge sandbox safely.
Furthermore, developers can implement the host functions for the extensions with the WasmEdge library.

In this chapter, we will discuss how to use WasmEdge SDKs to embed WasmEdge into [C](sdk/c.md), [Rust](sdk/rust.md), [Go](sdk/go.md), [Node.js](sdk/node.md), and [Python](sdk/python.md) host applications.
