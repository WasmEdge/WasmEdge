# Install and uninstall WasmEdge

## Quick install

The easiest way to install WasmEdge is to run the following command. Your system should have `git` and `wget` as prerequisites.

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash
```

If you would like to install WasmEdge with its [Tensorflow and image processing extensions](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/wasi-tensorflow/), please run the following command. It will attempt to install Tensorflow and image shared libraries on your system.

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- -e all
```

Run the following command to make the installed binary available in the current session `source $HOME/.wasmedge/env`

**That's it!** You can now use WasmEdge from the CLI, or launch it from an application. To update WasmEdge to a new release, just re-run the above command to write over the old files.

## Install for all users

By default, WasmEdge is installed in the `$HOME/.wasmedge` directory. You can install it into a system directory, such as `/usr/local` to make it available to all users. To specify an install directory, you can run the `install.sh` script with the `-p` flag. You will need to run the following commands as the `root` user or `sudo` since they write into system directories.

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- -p /usr/local
```

Or, with all extensions

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- -e all -p /usr/local
```

## What's installed

After installation, you have the following directories and files. Here we assume that you installed into the `$HOME/.wasmedge` directory. You could also change it to `/usr/local` if you did a system-wide install.

* The `$HOME/.wasmedge/bin` directory contains the WasmEdge Runtime CLI executable files. You can copy and move them around on your file system.
  * The `wasmedge` tool is the standard WasmEdge runtime. You can use it from the CLI. `wasmedge --dir .:. app.wasm`
  * The `wasmedgec` tool is the AOT compiler to compile a `wasm` file into a native `so` file. `wasmedgec app.wasm app.so` The `wasmedge` can then execute the `so` file. `wasmedge --dir .:. app.so`
  * The `wasmedge-tensorflow`, `wasmedge-tensorflow-lite` and `wasmedgec-tensorflow` tools are runtimes and compilers that support the WasmEdge tensorflow SDK.
* The `$HOME/.wasmedge/lib` directory contains WasmEdge shared libraries, as well as dependency libraries. They are useful for WasmEdge SDKs to launch WasmEdge programs and functions from host applications.
* The `$HOME/.wasmedge/include` directory contains the WasmEdge header files. They are useful for WasmEdge SDKs.


## Uninstall

To uninstall WasmEdge, you can run the following command.

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/uninstall.sh)
```

If `wasmedge` binary is not in `PATH` and it wasn't installed in the default `$HOME/.wasmedge` folder, then you must provide the installation path.

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/uninstall.sh) -p /path/to/parent/folder
```

If you wish to uninstall uninteractively, you can pass in the `--quick` or `-q` flag.

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/uninstall.sh) -q
```

> If a parent folder of the `wasmedge` binary contains `.wasmedge`, the folder will be considered for removal. For example, the script removes the default `$HOME/.wasmedge` folder altogether.
