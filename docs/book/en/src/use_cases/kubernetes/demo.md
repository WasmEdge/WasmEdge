# Demo apps

In this chapter, we will cover two demo apps. We will build them from Rust source code, build OCI images around them, and then publish the images to Docker Hub.

If you have not done so, please

* [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Register for Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

Next, explore the examples

* [A simple WASI example](demo/wasi.md)
* [A HTTP server example](demo/server.md)

Since we have already built and published those demo apps on Docker Hub, you could also just go straight to the container runtime sections to use these images.
