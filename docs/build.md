# Build and test from source

Please follow this guide to build and test WasmEdge from source code.

## Get Source Code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge.git
$ cd WasmEdge
```

## Check Dependencies

WasmEdge will try to use the latest LLVM release to create our nightly build. 
If you want to build from source, you may need to install these dependencies 
by yourself or using our docker images which provides several Linux distribution 
support.

- LLVM 12.0.0 (>= 10.0.0)
- GCC 11.1.0 (>= 9.4.0)

## Prepare the Environment

### Docker Images

Repository on dockerhub `wasmedge/wasmedge`

You can use the following commands to get our latest docker image:

```bash
$ docker pull wasmedge/wasmedge # Equals to wasmedge/wasmedge:latest
```

### Install dependencies on Ubuntu 20.04 manually

```bash
# Tools and libraries
$ sudo apt install -y \
	software-properties-common \
	cmake \
	libboost-all-dev

# And you will need to install llvm for wasmedgec tool
$ sudo apt install -y \
	llvm-12-dev \
	liblld-12-dev

# WasmEdge supports both clang++ and g++ compilers
# You can choose one of them for building this project
# If you prefer GCC
$ sudo apt install -y gcc g++
# Else you can choose clang
$ sudo apt install -y clang-12
```

### Support for legacy operating systems

Our development environment requires `libLLVM-12` and `>=GLIBCXX_3.4.33`.

If users are using the older operating system than Ubuntu 20.04, please use our special docker image to build WasmEdge.
If you are looking for the pre-built binaries for the older operatoring system, we also provide several pre-built binaries based on manylinux\* distribution.

### If you don't want to build Ahead-of-Time runtime/compiler

If users don't need Ahead-of-Time runtime/compiler support, they can set the CMake option `WASMEDGE_BUILD_AOT_RUNTIME` to `OFF`.

```bash
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWASMEDGE_BUILD_AOT_RUNTIME=OFF ..
```

## Build WasmEdge

WasmEdge provides various tools for enabling different runtime environments for optimal performance.
After the build is finished, you can find there are several wasmedge related tools:

1. `wasmedge` is for general wasm runtime.
	* `wasmedge` executes a `WASM` file in interpreter mode or a compiled WASM `so` file in ahead-of-time compilation mode.
	* To disable building all tools, you can set the CMake option `WASMEDGE_BUILD_TOOLS` to `OFF`.
2. `wasmedgec` is for ahead-of-time `WASM` compiler.
	* `wasmedgec` compiles a general `WASM` file into a `so` file.
	* To disable building the ahead-of-time compiler only, you can set the CMake option `WASMEDGE_BUILD_AOT_RUNTIME` to `OFF`.
3. `libwasmedge_c.so` is the WasmEdge C API shared library.
	* `libwasmedge_c.so` provides C API for the ahead-of-time compiler and the WASM runtime.
	* The APIs about the ahead-of-time compiler will always return failed if the CMake option `WASMEDGE_BUILD_AOT_RUNTIME` is set as `OFF`.
	* To disable building the shared library only, you can set the CMake option `WASMEDGE_BUILD_SHARED_LIB` to `OFF`.
4. `ssvm-qitc` is for AI application, supporting ONNC runtime for AI model in ONNX format.
	* If you want to try `ssvm-qitc`, please refer to [ONNC-Wasm](https://github.com/ONNC/onnc-wasm) project to set up the working environment and run several examples.
	* And here is our [tutorial for ONNC-Wasm project(YouTube Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbiPuHMS-iQ).

```bash
# After pulling our wasmedge docker image
$ docker run -it --rm \
    -v <path/to/your/wasmedge/source/folder>:/root/wasmedge \
    wasmedge/wasmedge:latest
(docker)$ cd /root/wasmedge
(docker)$ mkdir -p build && cd build
(docker)$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWASMEDGE_BUILD_TESTS=ON .. && make -j
```

## Run built-in tests

The following built-in tests are only available when the build flag `WASMEDGE_BUILD_TESTS` sets to `ON`.

Users can use these tests to verify the correctness of WasmEdge binaries.

```bash
$ cd <path/to/wasmedge/build_folder>
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/lib/api ctest
```

## Run applications

Next, follow [this guide](run.md) to run WebAssembly bytecode programs in `wasmedge`.
