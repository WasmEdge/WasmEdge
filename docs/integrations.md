WasmEdge is a "serverless" runtime for cloud native and edge computing applications. It allows developers safely embed third-party or "native" functions into a host application or a distributed computing framework.

# Embed WasmEdge into a host application

A major use case of WasmEdge is to start an VM instance from a host application. Depending on your host application's programming language, you can use WasmEdge SDKs to start and call WasmEdge functions.

* Embed WasmEdge functions into a C-based application using the [WasmEdge C API](c_api.md). Checkout the [quick start guide](c_api_quick_start.md).
* Embed WasmEdge functions into a Go application using the [WasmEdge Go API](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go). Here is a [tutorial](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/extend-golang-app-with-webassembly-rust/) and are some [examples](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go-examples)!
* Embed WasmEdge functions into a Rust application using the [WasmEdge Rust crate](../bindings/rust/wasmedge-rs).
* Embed WasmEdge functions into a Node.js application using the NAPI. Here is a [tutorial](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/).
* Embed WasmEdge functions into any application by spawning a new process. See examples for [Vercel Serverless Functions](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/vercel-wasmedge-webassembly-rust/) and [AWS Lambda](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/08/25/webassembly-serverless-functions-in-aws-lambda/).

However, the WebAssembly spec only supports very limited data types as input parameters and return values for the WebAssembly bytecode functions. In order to pass complex data types, such as a string of an array, as call arguments into Rust-based WasmEdge function, you should use the bindgen solution provided by the [rustwasmc](https://github.com/second-state/rustwasmc) toolchain. We currently supports bindgen in the [Node.js](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/) and in [Go](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/extend-golang-app-with-webassembly-rust/). We are working on [supporting interface types](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/264) in place of bindgen for future releases.

# Use WasmEdge as a Docker-like container

WasmEdge provides an OCI compliant interface. You can use container tools, such as CRI-O, Docker Hub, and Kubernetes, to orchestrate and manage WasmEdge runtimes.

* [Manage WasmEdge with CRI-O and Docker Hub](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/manage-webassembly-apps-in-wasmedge-using-docker-tools/).


# Call native host functions from WasmEdge

A key feature of WasmEdge is its extensibility. WasmEdge APIs allow developers to register "host functions" from any shared library into a WasmEdge instance, and then call these functions from the WebAssembly bytecode program. 

* The WasmEdge C API supports a [host function API](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/master/docs/c_api.md#Host-Functions).
* The WasmEdge Go API supports [external functions](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go-examples/tree/master/go_ExternRef).

The host functions break the Wasm sandbox to access the underly OS or hardware. But the sandbox breaking is done with explicit permission from the systemâ€™s operator.
