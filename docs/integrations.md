WasmEdge is a "serverless" runtime for cloud native and edge computing applications. It allows developers safely embed third-party or "native" functions into a host application or a distributed computing framework.

# Embed WasmEdge into a host application

A major use case of WasmEdge is to start an VM instance from a host application. Depending on your host application's programming language, you can use WasmEdge SDKs to start and call WasmEdge functions.

* Embed WasmEdge functions into a C-based application using the [WasmEdge C API](docs/c_api.md). Checkout the [quick start guide](docs/c_api_quick_start.md).
* Embed WasmEdge functions into a Go application using the [WasmEdge Go API](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go). Here is a [tutorial](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/extend-golang-app-with-webassembly-rust/) and are some [examples](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go-examples)!
* Embed WasmEdge functions into a Rust application using the [WasmEdge Rust crate](../wasmedge-rs).
* Embed WasmEdge functions into a Node.js application using the NAPI. Here is a [tutorial](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/).

However, the WebAssembly spec only supports very limited data types as input parameters and return values for the WebAssembly bytecode functions. In order to pass complex data types, such as a string of an array, as call arguments into Rust-based WasmEdge function, you should use the bindgen solution provided by the [rustwasmc](https://github.com/second-state/rustwasmc) toolchain.

We currently supports bindgen in the [Node.js](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/) and in [Go](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/extend-golang-app-with-webassembly-rust/). We are working on [supporting interface types](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/264) in place of bindgen for future releases.

# Use WasmEdge as a Docker-like container



# Call native host functions from WasmEdge

Sometimes, the Wasm bytecode alone could prove too limiting for some applications. WasmEdge provides a [host function API](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/blob/master/docs/host_function.md) that allows Wasm bytecode programs to load and call native library functions from the underlying host operating system.

Alternatively, you can register external functions as callbacks from the WasmEdge runtime. [Here is an example](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go-examples/tree/master/go_ExternRef) to register external functions in Go.

> The host functions break the Wasm sandbox. But the sandbox breaking is done with explicit permission from the systemâ€™s operator.

In fact, the extensions to WasmEdge are implemented using native host functions. For example, the [Tensorflow extension](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/wasi-tensorflow/) allows Wasm bytecode to make calls to the native Tensorflow library functions.
