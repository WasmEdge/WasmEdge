# Wish list

We are looking for developer help in the following areas. If you are working on any of the tasks, please [create an issue](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues) and let us know!

ðŸ‘‰ Improvements to technical documentation, examples, and tutorials. 

ðŸ‘‰ Non-English language translations of documentation and tutorials.

ðŸ‘‰ Create a serverless framework template to support WasmEdge with its Tensorflow extensions in *AWS Lambda*. You can refer to our [template for AWS Lambda](https://github.com/second-state/aws-lambda-wasm-runtime).

ðŸ‘‰ Create a serverless framework template to support WasmEdge with its Tensorflow extensions in *Azure functions*. You can refer to [our template for Tencent Cloudâ€™s SCF](https://github.com/second-state/tencent-tensorflow-scf).

ðŸ‘‰ Create a serverless framework template to support WasmEdge with its Tensorflow extensions in *Google cloud functions*. You can refer to [our template for Tencent Cloudâ€™s SCF](https://github.com/second-state/tencent-tensorflow-scf).

ðŸ‘‰ Create a Python SDK for WasmEdge VM. You can refer to our [golang SDK example](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go). 

ðŸ‘‰ Create a Rust SDK for WasmEdge VM. You can refer to our [golang SDK example](https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-go).

ðŸ‘‰ Enhance the [WasmEdge-core NAPI](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-napi) to fully support wasm-bindgen in Node.JS. It currently only supports a few call arguments, and does NOT support [WebAssembly programs calling out to JS functions](https://github.com/second-state/wasm-learning/tree/master/nodejs/nodejs_example). [See an example](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/) on how the NAPI is used.
